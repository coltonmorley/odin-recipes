    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is a pretty cool looking bowl of soup.  When using the default website
        provided by The Odin Project, I surprisingly had a lot of trouble saving their
        image of the Kentucky Tomato Soup.  For that reason the photo above is actually
        a photo of vegetable soup that I retrieved from the internet.

        Me personally? Not really super big into soup.  In fact I am not entirely sure 
        why this is the entree that I ended up creating first.  Seems pretty foolish
        in hindsight but hey, I am in far too deep to start second guessing it now.
